This is my journey at IIT Madras.




## Sri Gurubhyo Namaha

This is my professor at IIT Madras, he played a key role in guiding me for completion of my MS at IIT Madras. The perks I get after complition are all becoz of him. Its 2023 a decision has to be taken to choose my prof and I have choosen Prof.Kaushik Mitra, not only for his deep expertise for computer vision space but also in spiritual space. I belived I could learn something more along with education. With the rise of power in Internet people can learn anything, but you cant shape out yourself to a better person in character unless you meet one who is better than you. I believed he is the one to work under and need to be like him. The lab has a good ecosystem just becuase of my professor is what I believe.I am happy that, I have chance to work under him and serve him in the lab.

The init times were tough managing the education and the job at the same time were on of the biggest things that i have to do. My dreams were to build something big. Hanging out with frnds and mainitaing a circle was just not possible. But somehow I have made them on the way and they have influenced in the right way showing that frnds are most imp along with the degress you get here at IIT. My undergrad was so bad, but IIT was there to fix it all, frm friends to education.


## The HINDI group

Being a south indian and introvert, i never really had a necessity to go hangout with north guys. But somethings lead me to meet Hrithik marking the first person to be my first frnd at IIT, he was there during the tough times and the fun times. Telling me that we are here to enjoy and need to chill up along with studying. The time we spent is just lit, from late night dinners, walks, taking about the problems in labs, everthing. Despite being a stupid hrithik was a honest and good person. there is a borderline between being crazy and being normal, i can confidently say he has his legs on both the sides. God, but that was fun to be honest when I turn back and see. Coz you will never be in 20's to do this shit again in life.

## I Here by decarle this man(Vinayak) as a part of my Family

I dont give a shit what anyone thinks, but becoz of this guy's motivation I got my MS done and things went in the way I wanted. A random call this guys called me and told we should cook some work on 3D computer vision and I was heistant to tell yes, but due to common theme of krishna Bhakti, "I was yes, lets cook". That decision was one of the best decision to take and I now have a newly added member of my family. This guy works like hell and doesnt have any much frnds just like myself. We went through the same pain and shared same ambitions. We worked together on mulitple projects and published around 2 papers togther. The better part is his family is my family too, which is even more joyful. 

With mutual trust between our families, we went together to go to Milan, Italy for ECCV presentation. Then a really good spiritual trip one in north and one in south further to meet Lord Vishnu and Shiva, which are splendid. I get to know a lot of stuff from a younger person of being responsible and taking the right decision for education and life.

## Its not Computer Vision but its Computational Imaging Lab

I love images, the way they are capture on what kinda cameras, how to caputure pretty stuff and how to remove the blur or certain degradations from the image. This is what i did at IIT, its simple as that. Nthg complicated much. But its hard once u start writing the code, now when u got  some trouble I look up at my lab and people. The team is humble and then humblness comes from my Prof.Kaushik Mitra. We know we are there for each other and will somehow solve things. There are tough times alone in research, good times are rare, since AI Reseach is tough at the current situation. But the lab support each other and helped me to push my papers to conference. I couldnt have done things without my teammates.
